# A Collection of Algorith Implementations

- This repository is a practice ground for my algorithmic design and implementation abilities.
- The same algorithm may be implemented multiple times, eacha different approach, or just once with the best impl honed.
- There are collections of algorithm groups ranging from graph search algorithms to sorting and filtering algorithms.
- Each has an implementation in several languages, ranging from my usual skillset, to outlier langs seeking to test my abilites.
